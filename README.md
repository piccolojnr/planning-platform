## **Getting Started**  
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### **Prerequisites**  
- Node.js (v18 or higher)  
- Supabase account  
- Groq API key  

### **Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-project-planner.git
   cd ai-project-planner
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:  
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
   ```

4. Start the development server:  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## **Supabase Setup**  
1. Create a new project in Supabase.  
2. Enable Edge Functions and Realtime.  
3. Create a `chat_messages` table:  
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE chat_messages (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     project_id TEXT NOT NULL,
     role TEXT NOT NULL,
     content TEXT NOT NULL,
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

4. Deploy the Edge Functions:  
   - `conversation-phase`: Handles the AI conversation.  
   - `plan-generation-phase`: Generates the project plan.  

---

## **Groq Integration**  
1. Sign up for Groq and get your API key.  
2. Use the Groq SDK to interact with the AI model.  
3. Update the Edge Functions to use the Groq API.  

---

## **Usage**  
1. **Start a Conversation**  
   - Enter a project description (e.g., "Build a task management app").  
   - The AI will ask questions to gather details.  

2. **Generate a Plan**  
   - Once the AI has enough information, it will respond with `<GENERATE>`.  
   - The platform will generate a structured project plan.  

3. **Customize the Plan**  
   - Add, edit, or delete tasks.  
   - Adjust timelines and milestones.  

4. **Follow the Plan**  
   - Use the step-by-step instructions to execute the project.  
   - Ask questions if you need help.
